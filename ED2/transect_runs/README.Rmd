title: "ED2 North America Transect Runs"
output: github_document

### Overview

This folder contains inputs and scripts to simulate Setaria growth using ED2 for various sites. 

Each subfolder in the `transect_runs` folder is for a single site. Each site and associated files/folders are identifiable by a unique two-letter acronym. PFTs, initial conditions, and time ranges can vary by site and are documented here. 

### Sites information

1. Santa Rita site in southern Arizona
    - Acronym: SR

    - Simulation PFTS: Setaria, C3 grass
    - Simulation initial conditions: no patch or cohort
    - Simulation time range: March - September 2019
    - Number of ensembles: 50
2. Walker Branch site in eastern Tennessee
    - Acronym: WB

    - PEcAn site ID: 1000000042
    - Simulation PFTS: Setaria, C3 grass
    - Simulation initial conditions: no patch or cohort
    - Simulation time range: March - September 2019
    - Number of ensembles: 50

### Setting up a new site

- Set up files and folders
  - Copy the `new_site` folder and its contents and re-name it to a two-letter acronym for the new site
- Get MERRA weather for site and dates
  - Modify `weather/pecan.xml` as indicated in the comments
    - Update `outdir` to form `/data/sites/xx_weather_only`
    - `dbfiles` MUST be set to `/data/sites`
    - Update site ID
    - If needed, change run and met start and end dates; files take a long time to download and have to be consecutive with already downloaded files, so be mindful of the date ranges chosen; might need to delete files on BetyDB if weather data has already been downloaded for a site
  - Modify `weather/workflow.R`
    - This is a truncated workflow script that goes through `do_conversions`
      - Update path to read in corresponding `pecan.xml`
  - Run `weather/workflow.R`
- Run ED2 Pecan workflow
  - Modify `run/pecan.xml` as indicated in comments
    - Set `outdir` path to form of `/data/tests/ed2_transect_XX`
    - Update site ID
    - If needed, change run and met start and end dates
    - Set ED2 tag `IED_INIT_MODE` to 6 if patch/cohort, to 0 if no patch/cohort
  - Modify `run/workflow.R`
    - Update path to read in corresponding `pecan.xml`
  - Run `workflow.R` (this will take a while and you might want to run in a background R session with "Source as local job...")
- Plot results
  - Update `outdir_name` in `plots.R`
  - Run `plots.R`

### TODO

- Once patch and cohort files are working, add new site instructions here
